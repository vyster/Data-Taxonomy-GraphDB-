### Taxonomies, Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs
TBF

### Why use Graph DB over relational Analytics?
Graph databases understand the connections in large and varied data sets
- 1000 times faster than MySQL Queries
- Ease Visualization
- Finding Trilogies
- Recommendation (Product/Search/Generic)
- Analysis of graph structured data help usto provide invaluable insights about the relationships between entities, as well as enable optimizations over a network of interconnected objects [w.r.t. Conventional Methods]
- Ability to adapt changes better than most.
- Calculate best route by certain algorithms [DIJKSHTRA's] of connected semi structured data

### Used cases [AO specific]

1.0 Complex Graph Search Models and [or by Cooccurence]
2.0 Improve Tagging Accuracy
3.0 Develop a new Hierarchy Management Platform [HMP] Legacy system to store taxonomies.
4.0 Online Directory of Athenas Owl.


Neo$j to store and access the Data
Cypher to query.
